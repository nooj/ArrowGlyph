# ArrowGlyph

<a href="https://github.com/nooj/ArrowGlyph">ArrowGlyph</a> is a generalization of the ParaView Glyph filter for arrows; it allows independent resizing of tip and shaft.

<a href="https://www.paraview.org/">Paraview</a> is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization application. 

## Installation
To install, manually compile ParaView with the ArrowGlyph plugin configured.  <a href="https://www.paraview.org/documentation/">ParaView documentation</a>

According to <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/16902">Issue #16902</a>, it is slowly making its way into a ParaView release.

## History
I arranged for this to be created in 2010.  I and others needed a more versatile arrow glyph.  It initially gained traction from the slow-moving 
<a href="https://paraview.uservoice.com/forums/11350-general/suggestions/450560-glyphs-scale-only-the-arrow-length-instead-of-the">
ParaView Feature Request</a> forum.

I first put this github repo up as a way to publicly share it, 
and posted it as <a href="https://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=13660">Bug #13660</a>.  Several generous people, especially <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/wascott">W. Alan Scott</a> 
tested it and added it to the new bug tracker as 
<a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/issues/16902">Issue #16902</a>.
